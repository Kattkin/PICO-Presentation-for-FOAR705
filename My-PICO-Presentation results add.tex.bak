\frametitle{My Research Topic}
During my MRes course, I plan to research the influence of Korean Pop (Kpop) within Japan.
\newline
You can find advertisements for Kpop all around Tokyo, but where is the research on this phenomenon?

Initially, I had several areas where using a digital tool could improve the flow and pace of my work.
\newline
\item - Compiling sources for literature research
\item - Analysis of survey data
\item - Transcription and Translation of Interviews
\item - Writing and formatting my final Thesis
\newline
\newline
Out of these four areas, I considered survey data analysis to be the most time-consuming, so I decided to work on saving time here through implementing a digital tool.

\framesubtitle{Elaboration}
In order to choose the correct tool to use, I had to refine my input and output sources. These went through many iterations, but eventually ended up like this:
\newline
\newline
- Input: Raw data collected from an online survey site that is capable of producing both qualitative and quantitative data and presenting it in a CSV format.
\newline
- Output: A dataset that can receive queries for specific subsets, answer these queries and plot the results in a graphical format.
\newline
\newline
Due to my choice of input and output, I was able to pick R as my intended tool-of-choice.

\subsection{Creating a Tool Chain}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Implementation}
\framesubtitle{Creating a Tool Chain}
To begin with, I needed to prove that R could take a basic .csv input and create my desired output. To do this, I created my own small table of data, before loading it into the R environment and constructing a plot.  
\newline
\newline
This tool chain was a success, so I was then able to continue onto using more complex data, in a similar style to what I intended on using in my final thesis.

Now I knew that my tool chain worked with simple data, created a more complicated chain.

Google Forms survey (real-world data collection)

$\,\to\,$
Data analysis in R
\newline
$\,\to\,$ 
Graph imported into a Word document
\end{center}
\newline
The survey was completed by my FOAR705 class. With this new data I created a tabular database that could answer all the questions I asked.

\frametitle{Results}
\framesubtitle{Cons:}
\item -R support online is often outdated for the current version (code changes)
\item -Time is still currently an issue in terms of utilising this tool - however, I would say that if R is implemented properly, there will likely be fewer problems concerning data breaking under manipulation.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Conclusion}
My implementation of R as a tool for data analysis has been successful.
\newline 
I am now able to ask questions of R, and receive graphical responses with ease.
\newline 
This success means that I can replicate the same process shown here with my thesis data with minimal difficulty.
