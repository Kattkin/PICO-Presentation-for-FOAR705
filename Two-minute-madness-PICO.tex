\frametitle{My Research Topic}
During my MRes course, I plan to research the influence of Korean Pop (Kpop) within Japan.
\newline
You can find advertisements for Kpop all around Tokyo, but where is the research on this phenomenon?

I used R to form a code line that could analyse specific groups of responses out of the thousands I could receive from an online survey.
R allows me to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Immediately take online responses from surveys
\item Input them into a well-structured database
\item Select specific groups within the database
\item Create graphs of my data
\end{itemize}
With this tool chain, I am well-prepared to start my research in the months to come!
