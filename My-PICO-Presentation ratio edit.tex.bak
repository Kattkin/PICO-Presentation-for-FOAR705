\frametitle{My Research Topic}
During my MRes course, I plan to research the influence of Korean Pop (Kpop) within Japan.
\newline
You can find advertisements for Kpop all around Tokyo, but where is the research on this phenomenon?

Initially, I had several areas where using a digital tool could improve the flow and time-consumption of my work.
\newline
\item - Compiling sources for literature research
\item - Analysis of survey data
\item - Transcription and Translation of Interviews
\item - Writing and formatting my final Thesis
\newline
\newline
Out of these four areas, I considered survey data analysis to be the most time-consuming, so I decided to work on saving time here through implementing a digital tool.

In order to choose the correct tool to use, I had to refine my input and output sources. These went through many iterations, but eventually ended up like this:
\newline
\newline
- Input: Raw data collected from an online survey site that is capable of producing both qualitative and quantitative data and presenting it in a CSV format.
\newline
- Output: A dataset that can receive queries for specific subsets, answer these queries and plot the results in a graphical format.
\newline
\newline
Due to my choice of input and output, I was able to pick R as my intended tool-of-choice.

\subsection{Creating a Tool Chain}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Implementation}
\framesubtitle{Creating a Tool Chain}
To begin with, I needed to prove that R could take a basic .csv input and create my desired output. To do this, I began by creating my own small table of data, before loading it into the R environment and constructing a plot.  
\newline
\newline
This tool chain was a success, so I was then able to continue onto using more complex data, in a similar style to what I intended on using in my final thesis.

\framesubtitle{Elaborating on my Chain}
Now I knew that my tool chain worked with simple data, I decided to create a more complicated chain. This time, I would create a survey; mimicking question formats potentially suitable for my thesis.
\newline
For this, I created a simple survey via Google Forms. The number of questions were still kept to a minimum, and I asked my classmates and co-convenors to fill out this questionnaire. I then intended to construct normalised data grids within R, save them each as new, separate CSVs, before taking each and constructing graphs from them.
\newline
However, I have not yet completed this task. I intend to focus on this task in the next few weeks (until the date of the final formal presentation).

\framesubtitle{Cons:}
\item -R support online is often outdated for the current version (code changes)
\item -Time is still currently an issue in terms of utilising this tool - however, I would say that if R is implemented properly, there will likely be fewer problems concerning data breaking under manipulation.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Conclusion}
So far, my implementation of R as a tool for data analysis; taking simple raw csv data from online survey sites and producing clear graphical data for word processing and typesetting software has been successful. It still remains to be seen if I can effectively manipulate more complicated data. However, I am confident that with this technical skillset I have learnt in the process of undertaking my Proof of Concept, I will be more prepared to solve potential problems with my data, and will have saved time that will be valuable elsewhere during my MRes course.
