\frametitle{My Research Topic}
During my MRes course, I plan to research the influence of Korean Pop (Kpop) within Japan.
\newline
You can find advertisements for Kpop all around Tokyo, but where is the research on this phenomenon?

\frametitle{Data Analysis in R}
%include font and spacing?%
I used R to form a code line that could analyse specific groups of responses out of the thousands I could receive from an online survey.
R allows me to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Immediately take online responses from surveys
\item Input them into a well-structured database
\item Select specific groups within the database
\item Create graphs of my data
\end{itemize}
With this tool chain, I am well-prepared to start my research in the months to come!

Initially, I had several areas where using a digital tool could improve the flow and pace of my work.
\begin{itemize}
\item Compiling sources for literature research
\item Analysis of survey data
\item Transcription and Translation of Interviews
\item Writing and formatting my final Thesis
\end{itemize}
Out of these four areas, I considered survey data analysis to be the most time-consuming, so I decided to work on saving time here through implementing a digital tool.

\framesubtitle{Elaboration}
In order to choose the correct tool to use, I had to refine my input and output sources. These went through many iterations, but eventually ended up like this:
\begin{itemize}
\item Input: Raw data collected from an online survey site that is capable of producing both qualitative and quantitative data and presenting it in a spreadsheet (CSV) format.
\item Output: A dataset that can receive queries for specific subsets, answer these queries and plot the results in a graphical format.
\end{itemize}
Due to my choice of input and output, I was able to pick R as my intended tool-of-choice.

\subsection{Creating a Tool Chain}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}

\framesubtitle{Creating a Tool Chain}
I needed to prove that R could take a basic spreadsheet (CSV) input and create my desired output. To do this, I created my own small table of data, before loading it into the R environment and constructing a plot.  
\newline
\newline
This tool chain was a success, so I was then able to continue onto using more complex data, in a similar style to what I intended on using in my final thesis.

Now I knew that my tool chain worked with simple data, created a more complicated chain. 
\begin{center}
Google Forms survey (real-world data collection) 
\newline
$\,\to\,$
Data analysis in R
\newline
$\,\to\,$ 
Graph imported into a Word document
\end{center}
The survey was completed by my FOAR705 class. With this new data I created a tabular database that could answer all the questions I asked.

\framesubtitle{The Database}
In order to avoid errors when asking my data various questions, I broke the database down into a number of connected tables.
\newline
\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{Diagram}
\end{figure}
These could be joined together at will when necessary for answering a question.
In order to prove my concept, I decided to examine 18-29 year olds' music tastes, and place the data into a bar plot.

\framesubtitle{Pros:}
\begin{itemize}
\item General growth of my technical skillset
\item Success in using R to create simple tool chains
\item Increased knowledge of technical tools available for implementation in a range of tasks
\item The structure of the database can be used for much larger spreadsheets with thousands of entries

\frametitle{Results}
\framesubtitle{Cons:}
\begin{itemize}
\item R support online is often outdated for the current version (code changes)
\item Time is still currently an issue in terms of utilising this tool - however, I would say that if R is implemented properly, there will likely be fewer problems concerning data breaking under manipulation. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Conclusion}
My implementation of R as a tool for data analysis has been successful.
\newline 
I am now able to ask questions of R, and receive graphical responses with ease.
\newline 
This success means that I can replicate the same process shown here with my thesis data with minimal difficulty.
